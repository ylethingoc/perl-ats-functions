  # Helpful tips:  The contents of this file need to be edited to match
  # the Openstack Installation and Tenant that you are using.
  # This file provides some default values for the heat template used to 
  # spin up an SBX - either Single or HA.
  #
  # In particular you should substitute in the IDs or names of the networks and
  # subnets that have been set up in your Tenant. (Note: If your installation
  # has many tentants and if they are likely to use the same names for their 
  # networks, use the ID instead since it is unique. If repeated netnames are
  # unlikely, the names will suffice.) 
  # You can find these using the Openstack Horizon Dashboard, by navigating 
  # to the Networks page and clicking on the network or subnet name.
  #
  # I strongly advise anyone who is going to use Openstack a lot to
  # create for themselves a linux machine with the Openstack CLI tools
  # installed on it.  You can access the Openstack CLI of an Openstack
  # installation from a remote machine that has just the CLI tools on it.
  # You will need to source the environment variables on the tool machine
  # that define your Openstack login user name, pwd, tentant name and the
  # address of the Openstack host.
  # You might try this link: http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html
  # Here's an example of the ENV vars you need to use the tool:
  #   unset OS_SERVICE_TOKEN
  #   export OS_USERNAME=jack
  #   export OS_PASSWORD=mypassword
  #   export OS_AUTH_URL=http://10.8.85.8:5000/v2.0
  #   export PS1='[\u@\h \W(jack)]\$ '
  #
  #   export OS_TENANT_NAME=JacksCableCo
  #   export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
  #
  #  Once you have set this up, you can use comands like this to find all the IDs of all the
  #
  #  networks:
  #  > neutron net-list
  #  > neutron subnet-list
  #  .. Or on Liberty versions and forward this should also work:
  #  > openstack network list
  #  > openstack subnet list
  #
  #  Note that while the CLI can be much a much faster way to navigate lists of networks, 
  #  the same functions can be done via the GUI, and may be recommended partice at your installation.
  #
  #  Be sure to replace the flavor and security_group name with either the name or ID
  #  of a flavor or sec group that actually exist on your Openstack installation/tenant.
  #  Comment out the name of the standby machine for standalone installs. Otherwise
  #  you will want to leave the SBC names as they are.
